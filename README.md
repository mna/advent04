# Advent of code 2019

This is my code for the [Advent of Code 2019][advent] puzzles, done in the [nim][]
programming language. This is a new-ish programming language that I just started using
for fun, so the solutions might be less elegant than they could/should be!

To build, install nim and run:

```
$ nimble run advent04.nimble
```
